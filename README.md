## Thanks
I'm currently tracking my submissions to LeetCode with the open-source [LeetSync extension](https://github.com/3ba2ii/LeetSync). A big thank you to [@3ba2ii](https://github.com/3ba2ii) for the extension,  it works great on the new website design so definitely go check it out if you're prepping with LC.
